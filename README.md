# Godot Twin Stick Shooter Player
Made it during a mini Game Jam that I proposed to myself, namely "JamDeUmDia". I was developing a game during 24 hours, but stopped after only 12, only finishing some assets and the player code. This repo is the result of that sprint.

The player controls are **WASD** for movement and **mouse** or **keyboard arrow keys** for aim and shoot. Using the keyboard arrow keys, you shoot by pressing any key aiming at the selected arrow direction; using the mouse, you shoot by pressing the mouse left button aiming at the mouse position.
