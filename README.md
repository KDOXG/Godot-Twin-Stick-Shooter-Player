# Godot Twin Stick Shooter Player
This small framework for a twin-stick shooter player in Godot 4 is the result of a spring that I proposed to myself. I was developing a game during 24 hours, but stopped after only 12, only finishing some assets and the player code.

The player controls are **WASD** for movement and **mouse** or **keyboard arrow keys** for aim and shoot. Using the keyboard arrow keys, you shoot by pressing any key aiming at the selected arrow direction; using the mouse, you shoot by pressing the mouse left button aiming at the mouse position.
